JIO sip trunk details:

            Once you have purchased  the new jio sip trunk, you will be provided with below details

DID numbers
Pilot number
SIP gateway IP & Media IP
Jio Network subnet range (server IP,subnet, gateway IP)

  Step 1: Network Connection
            As show in picture above ,connect your Asterisk server to the JIO network and assign the IP address from the subnet provided by jio either to a second ethernet or existing ethernet port(based on your network design).
The network configuration is not covered here , it might defer between OS type you are using, but concept is same.

  Step 2:  JIO SIP Proxy Static route
       If you are connecting JIO to your existing networks as pre the picture shown, then you might need a dedicate route to reach the JIO SIP Proxy also media ip.
Strict RTP switching to RTP target address 
Check your OS network settings to set static route to jio network.
Sample JIO Sip details

SIP proxy ip    :100.64.216.4
Media IP          :100.64.216.4
ServerIP           : 100.65.161.116
gateway ip       :100.65.161.113
interface           : Eth1
Centos 7 command to set a static route to SIP proxy ip and media ip

ip route add 100.64.216.4 via 100.65.161.113 dev eth1
ip route add 100.64.216.5 via 100.65.161.113 dev eth1
Command to check the routes
ip route show 
or
route -n
  Step 3: JIO SIP peer configuration sip.conf
     Once you have setup the network , make sure you are able to reach the JIO gateway and SIP gateway ip by ping command.
       enter the below sip settings in you asterisk sip.conf,  if are using Freepbx you can create the same in Gui trunk settings, similar for vicidial/goautodial under carrier settings.

[jiosiptrunk]

type=friend
disallow=all
allow=alaw
allow=ulaw
allow=g729
host=100.XXX.XXX.XXX ;this is jio sip proxy ip
fromdomain=100.XXX.XXX.XXX ;this is jio sip proxy ip
qualify=yes
dtmfmode=rfc2833
nat=no
context=from-trunk  ;context to receive inbound calls
sendrpid=yes
trustrpid=yes

  Step 4: asterisk dialplan for jio sip
Note: The key factor to dial out via JIO , you need to set proper caller-id while dialing out.
Use the below dialplan , alter according to your requirement.
For vanilla Asterisk :
exten => _X.,1,Set(CALLERID(num)=+914412345678)
exten => _X.,2,Dial(SIP/jiosiptrunk/${EXTEN})
exten => _X.,3,Hangup
;+914412345678 is my pilot no, you have to enter your pilot no or any number from the DID range

Vicidial / Goautodial

exten => _X.,1,AGI(agi://127.0.0.1:4577/call_log)
exten => _X.,2,Set(CALLERID(num)=+914412345678)
exten => _X.,3,Dial(SIP/jiosiptrunk/${EXTEN},,tTo)
exten => _X.,4,Hangup
;+914412345678 is my pilot no, you have to enter your pilot no or any number from the DID range

Freepbx 
    If  you want individual CID for each user make sure each user extension is configured with outbound callerid with there DID number. 
For Freepbx, you need create outbound route , with necessary Dial pattern and make sure to set the ROUTE CID (either pilot or DID numbers)
